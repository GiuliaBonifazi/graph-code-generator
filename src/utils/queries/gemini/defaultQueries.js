    CRITERIA:`
        Using the criteria provided and checking them against the graph provided below them, return an array of JSON objects with the following fields.
        Only reply with the JSON, add nothing but the JSON. Only write the array without enclosing it inside an object.
        Do not reply with anything else but the JSON text. Here are the fields for each object in the array:
        - "level", which can have values "E" for a criterion that has not been respected, "W" for one whose correctness could not be determined or "C" for one that has been respected
        - "id", which contains the id of the respective criterion.
        - "desc", which contains the description of the respective criterion.
        - "name", which contains the name of the respective criterion
        The criteria are the following:
